# LanguageCensor
This is my program created for cs50 pset6. It imports a library (in a strict format[see sample]) given from the user that contains numerous words (most likely bad words) and seeks them in the user text input, censoring into "#'s".

Unfortunately, the current version does not yet deal with punctuations contained within words, new version update coming later expects to contain this feature!
